## Telegram Commands

Send these to your bot on Telegram (must be an authorized user):

- `/start` â€” Start all bot services
- `/start_auto` â€” Start automatic bidding
- `/start_semi` â€” Start semi-automatic mode (alerts for manual review)
- `/stop` â€” Pause all services
- `/stop_auto` â€” Pause automatic bidding only
- `/stop_semi` â€” Pause semi-automatic mode only
- `/status` â€” Get current bot status and statistics

## Web API Usage

- `GET /` â€” Health check. Returns bot status.
- `GET /gen_proposal?project_id=...` â€” Generate proposal for a project.

Access these endpoints via browser or HTTP client (e.g. curl, Postman).

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies:** Ensure Python version and pip packages match requirements.
